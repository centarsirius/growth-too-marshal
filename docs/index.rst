GROWTH Target of Opportunity Marshal
====================================

This is the manual for the GROWTH Target of Opportunity Marshal, or ToO Marshal
for short. It is a platform that has been developed by the Global Relay of
Observatories Watching Transients Happen (GROWTH) collaboration in order to
coordinate follow-up observations of multimessenger transients. The ToO
Marshal's responsibilities include:

1. Ingest alerts for astrophysical multimessenger transients from LIGO/Virgo,
   IceCube, Fermi, Swift, and other experiments.

2. Notify on-duty GROWTH astronomers when multimessenger transients occur that
   meet triggering criteria for science programs.

3. Plan optimal observations for a heterogeneous network of ground-based
   telescopes including ZTF, DECam, KPED, Gattini, and GROWTH-India.

4. Submit observations to robotic telescope queues and monitor the progress of
   observations.

5. Provide a central interface for vetting candidates from these facilities in
   combination with external data sources including the Census of the Local
   Universe (CLU) galaxy catalog.

6. Automatically compose GCN Circular astronomical bulletins.

   *Caveat emptor*: This repository has been made publicly available in the
   spirit of open-source software. However, much of the code is very specific
   to the particular facilities, instruments, and data sources that we are
   using, and may not be immediately generalizable.
